At Vwani Roychowdhury's Lab at UCLA, I contributed to the development of PyHFO, a cutting-edge tool for detecting High-Frequency Oscillations (HFOs) in EEG data, specifically implementing the Hilbert (HIL) detector. PyHFO is a multi-window desktop application designed to efficiently classify artifacts and HFOs with spikes, offering significant improvements in detection algorithms for clinical and research use.

Through optimization efforts, I reduced detection run-time by a factor of 50 compared to state-of-the-art models, ensuring accuracy through comparative studies.
