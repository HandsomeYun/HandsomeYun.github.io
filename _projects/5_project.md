In collaboration with PhD candidate Zhengliang Zhao, my current research focuses on developing a Unified Surrogate Metric, which serves as a comprehensive measure to assess and compare the performance of various sensor configurations at smart intersections. I am responsible for designing and evaluating scenarios in CARLA, ensuring that the surrogate metric accurately reflects the effectiveness of different camera and LiDAR setups, including fisheye and infrared sensors. These setups are tested under various conditions to validate the metric and its ability to predict performance across diverse environments.

Our research aims to standardize the evaluation of sensor systems, bridging the gap between diverse algorithms and real-world applications at smart intersections. The surrogate metric provides a single, cohesive framework to quantify system performance, enabling researchers to better compare sensor setups and enhance tracking and detection accuracy. Under the supervision of Prof. Jiaqi Ma, this work will be submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) in September 2024, contributing to advancements in autonomous driving and sensor technology.
