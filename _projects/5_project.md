## Overview  
**Infra-Set** is a large-scale dataset designed to support **multi-modal infrastructure sensor placement evaluation** in **autonomous driving scenarios**. It covers **10 intersections** in **various CARLA towns**, each selected to represent diverse **geometries, traffic densities, and ambient conditions**, including varying lighting and weather conditions. The dataset provides a robust foundation for **cooperative perception research** by incorporating **multi-agent, multi-modal sensor configurations**.

## Key Features  
- **Diverse Intersection Selection**  
  - 10 intersections from **CARLA towns 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10**  
  - Includes **4 four-way intersections, 2 T-intersections, 1 bridge-entry intersection, 1 roundabout, 1 five-way intersection, and 1 highway-entry T-intersection**  
  - Categorized into **urban, highway, and rural** environments  
- **Large-Scale Dataset**  
  - Contains **144,000 scenario frames** with **2.6TB of data**  
  - Includes camera and LiDAR data from **at least nine sensor placements**  
- **Multi-Agent Object Tracking**  
  - Covers **four primary object categories: cars, pedestrians, cyclists, and trucks**  
  - Analyzes **object density and movement across various traffic conditions**  
- **Comparison with Existing Datasets**  
  - Outperforms other cooperative perception datasets in **number of intersections, infrastructure complexity, and sensor configurations**  
  - The **only dataset** designed specifically for **heterogeneous sensor placement research**

## Intersection Selection  
To ensure **diversity in the dataset**, we carefully selected **intersections** based on **real-world traffic flow and geometric variations**. The intersections are categorized as:  
- **Large intersections (4)**  
- **Medium-sized intersections (4)**  
- **Small intersections (2)**  

They are further classified by **environment type**:  
- **Urban intersections (6)**  
- **Highway intersections (3)**  
- **Rural intersection (1)**

### **Dataset Structure & Size**  
The dataset consists of:  
- **144,000 scenario frames**  
- **Data from 9+ unique sensor configurations**, including camera placements (**Cam-c, Cam-d1, Cam-d2, Cam-d3**) and LiDAR placements (**L-c, L-d1, L-d2**)  
- **2.6TB total data volume**  

## Data Analysis  
The dataset covers **three distinct traffic flow densities**:  
- **High-density** (~60 objects per scene)  
- **Medium-density** (~40 objects per scene)  
- **Low-density** (~20 objects per scene)  

Each scene includes a balanced **distribution of object types**, ensuring representation across **autonomous driving environments**.
