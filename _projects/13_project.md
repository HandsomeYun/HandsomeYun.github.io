## Overview

**RelMap** introduces a **relation-aware learning approach** for enhancing **online map generation**. Traditional online mapping methods struggle with **noisy observations, missing information, and weak relational reasoning**. RelMap addresses these challenges by incorporating **spatial and contextual relationships** between detected objects, significantly improving **mapping accuracy and robustness**.

## Key Contributions

- **Relation-Aware Learning**: Integrates object-object and object-environment relationships to enhance **spatial reasoning**.
- **Transformer-Based Architecture**: Utilizes **self-attention** to refine mapping predictions with contextual dependencies.
- **Efficient Online Learning**: Demonstrates superior performance even with **limited training data**.
- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Outperforms existing methods on **benchmark datasets**, improving both **precision and recall**.

## Model Architecture

RelMap employs a **Transformer-based pipeline** to capture high-level **spatial dependencies** between scene elements. It consists of:

1. **Feature Extraction** - Processing sensor data (LiDAR, cameras, radar).
2. **Relation-Aware Transformer** - Modeling **object-object** and **object-environment interactions**.
3. **Semantic Map Decoder** - Generating a **structured map representation** in real time.
