In this project, I developed an advanced brain tumor segmentation framework that leverages MiniGPT-4 to integrate four distinct MRI modalities: T1c, T1n, T2, and FLAIR. This multimodal approach enables the model to extract detailed information from each imaging modality, leading to more precise segmentation of brain tumors. By utilizing context-aware preprocessing techniques, the model achieves significant improvements in accuracy while minimizing false positives. The integration of these MRI modalities onto a common space ensures that the model captures intricate variations in tumor characteristics, leading to a 212.3% increase in segmentation precision.

The success of this approach lies not only in its technical innovation but also in its accessibility. The framework simplifies complex segmentation tasks, making it user-friendly for medical professionals without machine learning expertise. This work was recognized during a research symposium where I was awarded Best Presenter, and it subsequently led to a PhD offer with a Presidential Scholarship. The project stands as a testament to the potential of AI-driven solutions in medical imaging, offering a more reliable and efficient method for brain tumor diagnosis and treatment planning.
