Hi, I’m Yun Zhang, a first year PhD student at [UCLA's Mobility Lab](https://mobility-lab.seas.ucla.edu/), specializing in autonomous driving, computer vision, and physical intelligence. My research centers on building machines that understand and interact with the physical world, whether it’s a self-driving car navigating complex traffic or a robot moving safely among people.

At UCLA, I’ve developed perception and decision-making systems that integrate vision, motion, and spatial reasoning to improve real-world autonomy. As I begin my PhD, I aim to push the boundaries of embodied intelligence, creating agents that can perceive, plan, and adapt with human-level intuition and environmental awareness.
