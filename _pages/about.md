Hi, I’m Yun Zhang, a first-year PhD student at [UCLA's Mobility Lab](https://mobility-lab.seas.ucla.edu/). I work on physical intelligence, focusing on how machines perceive their surroundings, understand human intent, and interact safely and effectively with the world.

My recent projects explore how robots move through complex, dynamic environments and make informed decisions using visual, linguistic, and motion cues. I am broadly interested in building embodied systems that maintain reliability under real-world constraints and adapt to changing conditions, whether in navigation, interaction, or broader physical tasks.

I am also an Amazon Trainium Fellow, supported for my research on large-scale vision and action learning for embodied intelligence.
