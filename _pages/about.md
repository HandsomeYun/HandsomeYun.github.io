Hi, I’m Yun Zhang, a passionate researcher specializing in computational mathematics, data science, and multi-modal data-driven AI solutions. I’m currently pursuing my Bachelor’s degrees at UCLA, where I’ve developed expertise in AI, machine learning, and sensor technologies.

My research spans from using Large Language Models to enhance brain tumor segmentation, to optimizing sensor configurations for smart intersections in autonomous driving systems. With a deep interest in leveraging emerging technologies to drive innovation, I’m focused on applying AI to both medical imaging and automobile safety. This website reflects my journey as I pursue a PhD in either of these dynamic fields, where I aim to push the boundaries of AI and data science to make a meaningful impact.
