Hi, Iâ€™m Yun Zhang, an undergraduate and incoming PhD student at [UCLA's Mobility Lab](https://mobility-lab.seas.ucla.edu/), specializing in autonomous driving, multi-agent perception, and sensor fusion. My research focuses on cooperative perception, V2X communication, and intelligent transportation systems, aiming to enhance vehicle autonomy and real-time decision-making in connected environments.

At UCLA, I have worked on optimizing infrastructure-aware sensing, mitigating sensor misalignment in multi-agent systems, and developing spatio-temporal fusion techniques for V2X applications. As I embark on my PhD, I am dedicated to advancing AI-driven mobility solutions that improve safety, efficiency, and robustness in autonomous transportation.
