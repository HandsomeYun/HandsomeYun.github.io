I'm excited to share that I've been selected as a recipient of the [2025 RSS Pathway Fellowship Program](https://sites.google.com/lehigh.edu/pathways-rss2025/home?authuser=0#h.9k5jcvbajbml)! Grateful to RSS for this opportunity to connect with the robotics community and further explore my research interests.
