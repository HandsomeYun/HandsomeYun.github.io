  title={MIC-BEV: Multi-Infrastructure Camera Bird's-Eye-View Perception Transformer for 3D Object Detection},
  journal={Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), Best Paper Award for DriveX Workshop},

  abstract={MIC-BEV is a Transformer-based framework for multi-camera infrastructure perception. It performs 3D object detection and BEV segmentation by fusing features from multiple cameras through a geometry-aware graph module. Designed for diverse camera setups and harsh conditions, MIC-BEV maintains strong robustness under sensor degradation. To support this, we introduce M2I, a synthetic dataset covering varied layouts, weather, and viewpoints. Experiments on both M2I and the real-world RoScenes dataset show that MIC-BEV achieves state-of-the-art performance and reliability for real-world deployment. (Currently releasing the Workshop version)},
